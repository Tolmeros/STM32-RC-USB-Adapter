# STM32F1 Radio Control USB adapter.

Allows to connect RC transmitter to PC as a USB HID game controller.

Based on same project for STM32F3Discovery: https://github.com/alexeystn/stm32-ppm-usb-adapter, but ported for STM32F1 (tested on STM32F103C8) controllers.

Moved to GNU toolchain.

#Connections:
- RC PPM out <==> PA8
- RC GND <==> GND
